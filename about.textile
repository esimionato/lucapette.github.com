h1. About me

I'm a 28 years old guy and am really curious person. I live and work in Naples, Italy.
I have a nice "404":/404.html page.

h2. I love:

* All well performed music
* Books
* Git
* Guitar, guitar making, playing guitar, listen to guitar music
* Linux (all flavours, especially _Ubuntu_)
* Photography
* Rails
* Ruby

I love many other things too, but I wouldn't like to share them with the world.

h2. I hate:

* Dance music
* Internet Explorer
* Racism
* Timesheets
* Windows OS (all flavours, especially _all flavours_)

Surely there are a lot more things that I hate, but I don't want to share them with the world.
